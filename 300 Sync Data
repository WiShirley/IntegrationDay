## Create Connections and Review Catalog
1. Log into your Workshop DIPC Server
2.	In the Home Page click “Create Connection” from top section

![](images/200/image200_5.png)

3.	Enter the following information:
    - Name: SALES_SRC
    - Description: Sales OLTP Source Data
    - Agent: \<LOCAL_AGENT>
    - Type Oracle: selecting Oracle will expand the Connection Settings

    ![](images/200/image200_6.png)

    - Hostname: <SOURCE_DB>
    - Port: 1521
    - Username: SALES_SRC
    - Password: Welcome#123
    - Service Name: <SOURCE_DB_SERVICE_NAME>
    - Schema Name: SALES_SRC (Default) – When you try to select the schema, you are testing the connection at the same time
    - CDB Connection: SRC_CDB

    ![](images/200/image200_7.png)

4. Click "Test Connection" button and when the test is successful click "Save" button. DIPC will create the connection and will harvest the entities in the schema. You will be navigated to the Catalog and you will see, after some time, the connection you just created and the entities in that schema

**Note: Data Entities are harvested and profiled at the time the connection is created, their popularity is also calculated by reviewing the DB query logs. This process may take some time (5 minutes or so), the Catalog will show a message when new updates are available**

![](images/200/image200_8.png)

5.	Click on entity “SRC_CUSTOMER” to drill down in it and look at the information DIPC brought in

![](images/200/image200_9.png) 

If you would like to associate a tag or a contact to this entity, click on “Edit” button on the top right corner.

6.	Click on the “Metadata” tab on top

![](images/200/image200_10.png) 

DIPCS shows attributes, primary keys, data types and some sample values of the selected entity. If you click in one of the attributes, profiling information will be shown on the right side of the screen.

7.	Click on the “Data” tab on top

![](images/200/image200_12.png) 

8.	Click on the back icon, located on the top left corner (left of the entity name) to go back to the Catalog
9.	In the catalog you can use the drop-down menu located at the top to select the type of object that will be shown

![](images/200/image200_13.png)

10.	It is also possible to use the filter to search for a specific object

![](images/200/image200_14.png)

11.	Now, we are going to create the target connection. From the top bar, Open the drop-down menu from the top far right corner and then select “Connection” 

![](images/200/image200_15.png)

12.	Enter the following information:
    - Name: SALES_TRG 
    - Description: Sales OLTP Replicated Data
    - Agent: <LOCAL_AGENT>
    - Type Oracle – selecting Oracle will expand the Connection Settings
    - Hostname: <TARGET_DB>
    - Port: 1521
    - Username: SALES_TRG 
    - Password: Welcome#123

    - Schema Name: SALES_TRG  (Default)

![](images/200/image200_16.png)

13. Click "Test Connection" button and when the test is successful click "Save" button. DIPC will create the connection and will harvest the entities in the schema. You will be navigated to the Catalog and you will see, after some time, the new connection you just created and the entities in that schema (if any)


## Create Synchronize Data Elevated Task

1.	Connections have been defined. We are ready to create and execute our “Synch Data” elevated task. From the top bar, open the drop-down menu from the top far right corner and then select “Synchronize Data”

![](images/200/image200_15.png) 

2.	Provide the following information:
    - Name: Sync Sales Data
    - Description: Sync Schemas - SALES_SRC to SALES_TRG  
    - Source – Connection: SALES_SRC
    - Source – Schema: SALES_SRC – The default schema will be automatically selected. Leave it
    - Target – Connection: SALES_TRG 
    - Target – Schema: SALES_TRG  – The default schema will be automatically selected. Leave it
    - Advanced – Include Initial Load: SELECTED
    - Advanced – Include Replication: SELECTED

The “Advanced Options” allow you to optionally enable or disable the initial load and/or the on-going schema replication.

**Note: If you run into any issues when trying to select a Connection refresh the page manually. The Schemas may take some time to appear as well, this is expected.**

![](images/200/image200_17.png)

3.	Next click on “Configure Entities” on the top bar to filter the objects that will be transferred from source into target.

![](images/200/image200_18.png)
 
4.	The “Configure Entities” screen allows you to create include or exclude rules to define precisely which database objects will be moved over to the target schema. By default, all data entities are transferred. Enter SRC* in the "Rules" field and click on “Include” button.

![](images/200/image200_19.png)  

5.	Select the hamburger menu   (located on the right side of the row) of the rule you just created and select “Delete”. You should end up with the original rule only

![](images/200/image200_20.png)
 
6.	Click on “Save & Run” button on the top right to execute the task

![](images/200/image200_21.png)

7.	You will be navigated to the “Jobs” screen. After some time, a message will appear in the notification bar

![](images/200/image200_22.png)

8.	The job will automatically appear within the Jobs page. This may take up to 1 minute

![](images/200/image200_23.png) 

Auto-refresh is on, statuses will be updated frequently.

As the job executes, the Initial Load process is created in ODI while DIPC configures OGG for the Source Capture and Target Delivery.

## Review Task Execution

### In ODI Console (Optional)
The Initial Load process uses Data Pump and can be monitored within ODI Console. 

1.	Click on the picture icon located on the top right corner of the screen and then select “Open ODI”

![](images/200/image200_24.png)  

2.	Click on “Proceed” button

![](images/200/image200_25.png)  

3.	On the hierarchical panel on the left select “Runtime > Sessions > Sessions”. Then select the row.

![](images/200/image200_26.png)

4.	Now click on the “View” icon (sunglasses located on top left corner). This will open a tab on the right side with information about the executed sessions.

![](images/200/image200_27.png)

5.	Click on the session name to drill down and look at more detail

![](images/200/image200_28.png)

6.	Scroll down to see the detailed steps. When finished, you can close the browser tab with ODI Console

![](images/200/image200_29.png)



### Review Job in DIPC
1.	You should be in the “Jobs” screen. Click on the Job to see the Job Details. The Initial load Action will show Successful after a little while

![](images/200/image200_30.png) 

2.	Once done, the “Initial Load” Action can be expanded to review the various steps underneath

![](images/200/image200_31.png) 

3.	Click on “Procedure:Initial load_PROC:DBLINK_DATAPUMP” to review the code generated by DIPC for the Initial Load. 

![](images/200/image200_32.png) 

4.	Click Done when you’ve completed the code review
5.	Close “Initial Load” action. Let’s review what else has been created. You should see 5 Actions

![](images/200/image200_33.png)

DIPC has created and orchestrated the initial load and the data synchronization processes between the source (for example, an OLTP system) and the target (for example, an operational data store, stand-by copy, etc.) -- (additional details can be seen in the GG logs as well as within ODI Studio)

### Verify Data in Source and Target DBs (Optional)
Up until this point, we have monitored the job within DIPC but it would nice to see the data in both source and target to verify that they are the same. For such task, we will use SQL Developer; please refer to Appendix 3 to learn how to create connections against the workshop databases.

1.	Start SQL Developer. On the connections panel, select your source database (WS - SALES_SRC) and click on the plus (+) sign to open the connection

    ![](images/200/image200_34.png)
 
2.	Once opened, copy and paste the following statements in the panel on the right:

SELECT COUNT(*) AGE_GROUP FROM SRC_AGE_GROUP;

SELECT COUNT(*) CITY FROM SRC_CITY;

SELECT COUNT(*) CUSTOMER FROM SRC_CUSTOMER;

SELECT COUNT(*) ORDER_LINES FROM SRC_ORDER_LINES;

SELECT COUNT(*) ORDERS FROM SRC_ORDERS;

SELECT COUNT(*) PRODUCTS FROM SRC_PRODUCT;

SELECT COUNT(*) REGION FROM SRC_REGION;

SELECT COUNT(*) SALES_PERSON FROM SRC_SALES_PERSON;

3.	Execute the statements by clicking on the “Run script” icon (second icon from left to right on the icon bar; right-ponting green arrow head on top of a page)

![](images/200/image200_35.png)

4.	This will show all entities count on the results panel (lower section)

![](images/200/image200_36.png)

5.	Repeat steps 1 through 4 for connection “WS - SALES_TRG ”

    ![](images/200/image200_37.png)
 
This will show that the count in both data bases is exactly the same.

### Verify GG processes (Optional)
If you want to take a look and verify that the GG processes (extract and replicat) are running, these are the steps:

1.	Open an SSH session into the DIPC server; please refer to Appendix 1 to learn how to establish a SSH session against the DIPC server
2.	Execute: source .ggsetup 
3.	Execute: /u01/app/oracle/suite/gghome/ggsci

![](images/200/image200_38.png)

4.	You are now in GG console, execute: info all

![](images/200/image200_39.png)

Now you have verified that both Extract and Replicat are running. Exit from GGSCI

## Monitor Data Changes 

We are going to apply some changes to the source DB and verify how our “Synchronize Data” task takes care of these changes and replicates them to the target.

1.	Go to your SQL Developer and expand “WS - SALES_SRC” connection and its tables.

![](images/200/image200_40.png)
 
2.	Select “SRC_CUSTOMER” table
3.	On the right panel, select “Data” tab

![](images/200/image200_41.png)

4.	Click on “Insert Row” ( ) icon and provide the following data:
    - CUSTID: 1000
    - DEAR: 0
    - LAST_NAME: Parker
    - FIRST_NAME: Peter
    - ADDRESS: 1200 Smith Street
    - CITY_ID: 12
    - PHONE: (510) 556 4879
    - AGE: 48
    - SALES_PERS_ID: 12
 
![](images/200/image200_42.png)

5.	Click on “Commit” icon to insert the row into the DB (fifth icon from left to right on the icon bar; green checkmark on top of a disk)
6.	Verify the insert in the target. Go to SQL developer and expand “WS - SALES_TRG ” connection and its tables

![](images/200/image200_43.png)
 
7.	Select “SRC_CUSTOMER”  table
8.	On the right panel, select “Data” tab. You will need to scroll all the way down to see the new row

![](images/200/image200_44.png)
 
As data is updated, inserted or deleted from the source the data will be automatically synchronized with the replicated schema by the DIPC Sync Sales Data Job. 

9.	Go back to DIPC, you should be in the detail screen of the Data Synch job
10.	Verify that the screen has auto refresh ON so you will see the changes 

![](images/200/image200_45.png)
 
11.	It might take some time. The screen will reflect the insertion in the source
 
![](images/200/image200_46.png)

12.	And the insertion in the target

![](images/200/image200_47.png)
 
13.	Now, we will perform a delete. On your “WS - SALES_SRC” connection (SQL Developer) select “SRC_CUSTOMER” table
14.	On the right panel, select “Data” tab and look for “Peter Parker”, select it.

![](images/200/image200_48.png)

15.	Click on “delete icon (fourth icon from left to right on the icon bar; red X) 
16.	Click on “Commit” (fifth icon from left to right on the icon bar; green checkmark on top of a disk) icon 
17.	Let’s verify the deletion in the target. On your “WS - SALES_TRG ” connection (SQL Developer) select “SRC_CUSTOMER” table
18.	Look for “Peter Parker”, it will not be there
19.	Go back to DIPC, you should be in the detail screen of the Data Synch job
20.	It might take some time. The screen will reflect the deletion in the source

![](images/200/image200_49.png)

21.	And the deletion in the target

![](images/200/image200_50.png)

22.	Now let’s perform an update. On your “WS - SALES_SRC” connection (SQL Developer) select “SRC_CUSTOMER” table
23.	On the right panel, select “Data” tab and look for “Paul Brendt”, double click in his age

![](images/200/image200_51.png)

24.	Change it to 25

![](images/200/image200_52.png)

25.	Click on “Commit” (fifth icon from left to right on the icon bar; green checkmark on top of a disk) icon. This row will be automatically updated on the target as the DIPC Job picks up the change
26.	Let’s verify the update in the target. On your “WS - SALES_TRG ” connection (SQL Developer) select “SRC_CUSTOMER” table
27.	On the right panel, select “Data” tab and look for “Paul Brendt”, his age has change to 25
28.	Go back to DIPC, you should be in the detail screen of the Data Synch job
29.	It might take some time. The screen will reflect the update in the source

![](images/200/image200_53.png)

30.	And the update in the target

![](images/200/image200_54.png)
